== Frequently Asked Questions ==

As soon as your question arrives I will add it here.

= Some weird error message =
Do your server run php5? We need the "DOM" section of your phpinfo() show "enabled"-values.

= There's an error message like "ERROR: domdocument::domdocument() expects 2 parameter to be long" =
Disable the `domxml` extension of your php installation. `domxml` is a legacy extension introduced for php4 which lacks cool dom-functions. But in php5 they are built in and - guess what - **incompatible** with the old extension. So we rely on the new bright and shiny built-in functions.

= Can I use this plugin without a widget? =
Unfortunately this is not possible. As all options are set on a per-widget basis, there is no way to display a list without a widget.

= Can you translate the plugin to language [insert-your-language] =
No... but: **You can!** Just have a look at the translation files and/or contact me for further instructions.

== Other Notes ==

The *format of dates and times* are part of the translation files. Let me know if this should be another user-editable option.
